A package of utilities for reading and applying image processing to `Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) <https://www.ctao.org/>`_ R1/DL0/DL1 data in a standardized format. Created primarily for testing machine learning image analysis techniques on IACT data.

Currently supports ctapipe  >= v6.0.0 data format. 

Previously named image-extractor (v0.1.0 - v0.6.0). Currently under development, intended for internal use only.


Installation
------------

The lastest version fo this package can be installed as a conda or pip package:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install ctlearn-project::dl1_data_handler

or

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dl1-data-handler

Installing as a conda package

This should automatically install all dependencies (NOTE: this may take some time, as by default MKL is included as a dependency of NumPy and it is very large).
